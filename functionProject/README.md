# Your task:

Write a program which only has function calls in the main method.  It will look similar to the following:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
   do_thing_1( input1 );
   do_thing_2( inputs );
   do_thing_3( inputs );
}
//functions defined below here   
```
Your program should check 
# Submitting:
Use the following to submit your lab.  There are no automated checks to pass for this one (so you don't need to run check50).
