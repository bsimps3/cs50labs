# TicTacToe vs. a computer (a less dumb one) 
What are some easy ways we could make our random tic-tac-toe computer player better?

Implement at least 1 function which will make your tic-tac-toe computer player better.

Feel free to keep making it better and better with more functions.

## Example code:
To see an example of a working tictactoe program which is "smarter", do the following:

Run this command first.
```c
chmod +x example_better
```
Then run the following command to see the code working. 
```c
./example_better
```
Feel free to play this one to see if you can figure out how it is "better" or "smarter".  What is it doing that makes it better?

# Submitting:
Use the following to submit your lab.  There are no automated checks to pass for this one (so you don't need to run check50).
